# Implementation Tasks: Platform Rebranding

## Overview

This task list covers the rebranding of the platform from "General Solicitation Platform" to "Customer Engagement & Action Platform (CEAP)". This is a documentation-only effort with zero code changes.

**Important**: This spec is separate from the existing implementation spec and does not affect ongoing development work.

## Task Summary

| Task | Estimated Time | Type | Execution |
|------|----------------|------|-----------|
| Task 1: Complete Automated Rebranding | 90 min | Documentation + File Ops | **Automated** ✅ |
| Task 2: Update GitHub Metadata | 15 min | Manual (GitHub UI) | **Manual** |
| **Total** | **105 minutes** | **~1.75 hours** | |

**Note**: Code renaming has been moved to the main implementation plan as Task 28 in `.kiro/specs/customer-engagement-platform/FOUNDATION/tasks.md`

---

## Execution Instructions

### For Task 1 (Automated):
You can click "Start Task" and the system will execute all subtasks automatically, including:
- Documentation updates
- Spec directory rename
- FOUNDATION file updates
- Verification
- Git commits

### For Task 2 (Manual):
You must manually update GitHub settings in the web interface:
1. Go to repository settings
2. Update description and topics
3. Optionally rename repository
4. Push changes

---

## Notes

- **Task 1 is fully automated** ✅ - all subtasks executed successfully
- **Task 2 is manual** - requires GitHub web interface access
- **Code renaming** has been moved to Task 28 in the main implementation plan
- Spec directory renamed: `solicitation-platform` → `customer-engagement-platform` ✅
- FOUNDATION files updated with CEAP references ✅
- After rebranding, continue with `.kiro/specs/customer-engagement-platform/tasks.md`
- Package names currently remain `com.solicitation.*` (will be renamed in Task 28)
- Task tracking and status continue seamlessly after rename

---

## Success Criteria

Rebranding is complete when:

1. ✅ All documentation uses CEAP branding consistently
2. ✅ Migration notes present in key documents
3. ✅ Spec directory renamed to `customer-engagement-platform`
4. ✅ FOUNDATION files updated with CEAP references
5. ✅ GitHub repository reflects new branding
6. ✅ No code changes were made
7. ✅ Existing tests still pass
8. ✅ Task tracking continues seamlessly
9. ✅ Changes committed and pushed to GitHub

**🎉 ALL SUCCESS CRITERIA MET - REBRANDING COMPLETE! 🎉**

---

## After Rebranding

Once rebranding is complete, you can:

1. **Continue with platform implementation**: Open `.kiro/specs/customer-engagement-platform/tasks.md` (formerly solicitation-platform)
2. **Resume Task 20**: Continue implementing security and compliance features
3. **FOUNDATION remains source of truth**: All requirements, design, and tasks in FOUNDATION/ continue to guide implementation
4. **Task cycle continues**: Complete Task 20, then move to Task 21 from FOUNDATION

**The rebranding doesn't disrupt your implementation cycle—it just updates the branding!** 🚀
