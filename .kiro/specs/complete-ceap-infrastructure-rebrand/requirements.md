# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for completing the CEAP infrastructure rebrand by updating all remaining functional code identifiers. The project previously completed a documentation-only rename that updated comments, markdown docs, and test strings. Package names (`com.ceap.*`) and module names (`ceap-*`) are already correct. This phase focuses on updating approximately 50 functional code identifiers in infrastructure and runtime code, including class names, CloudFormation stack names, CloudWatch namespaces, EventBridge sources, DynamoDB table names, Lambda function names, and other infrastructure resource identifiers.

The project is in development phase, so breaking changes are acceptable. All changes should use CEAP branding consistently to complete the transition from the legacy "solicitation" terminology.

## Glossary

- **CEAP**: Customer Engagement and Acquisition Platform - the new brand name for the system
- **Solicitation**: Legacy terminology being replaced throughout the codebase
- **Functional Code Identifier**: Class names, variable names, resource names, and other identifiers that affect runtime behavior or infrastructure provisioning
- **Infrastructure Code**: CDK constructs, CloudFormation templates, and configuration files that define AWS resources
- **Runtime Identifier**: Names used during application execution including CloudWatch namespaces, EventBridge sources, and DynamoDB table names
- **CDK**: AWS Cloud Development Kit - infrastructure as code framework used in the project
- **CloudFormation Stack**: A collection of AWS resources managed as a single unit
- **EventBridge**: AWS service for event-driven architectures
- **CloudWatch**: AWS monitoring and observability service
