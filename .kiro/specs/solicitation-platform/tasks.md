# Implementation Tasks - Current Cycle

## Current Focus: Task 19 - Implement multi-program isolation

This task list shows the current 2-task implementation cycle. After completing these tasks, the next cycle will be loaded from FOUNDATION.

**Note**: Completed tasks are tracked in `completed-tasks.md` to keep this file focused on current work.

## Task Status Legend
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[~]` - In progress  
- `[x]` - Complete
- `[*]` - Property-based test task

## Current Task Cycle

- [x] Task 19: Implement multi-program isolation
- [-] Complete cycle - Commit, push, and setup next tasks

## Task 19 Details: Implement multi-program isolation

Ensure programs operate independently with failure isolation, program-specific throttling, and cost attribution.

### Subtasks:

- [x] 19.1 Add program failure isolation
  - Ensure program workflows are independent
  - Prevent cascading failures across programs
  - _Requirements: 13.1_

- [x]* 19.2 Write property test for program failure isolation
  - **Property 39: Program failure isolation**
  - **Validates: Requirements 13.1**

- [x] 19.3 Implement program-specific throttling
  - Track rate limits per program
  - Throttle only the exceeding program
  - _Requirements: 13.3_

- [x]* 19.4 Write property test for program-specific throttling
  - **Property 40: Program-specific throttling**
  - **Validates: Requirements 13.3**

- [x] 19.5 Add program cost attribution
  - Tag resources with program ID
  - Track costs per program
  - Publish cost metrics
  - _Requirements: 13.4_

- [x]* 19.6 Write property test for program cost attribution
  - **Property 41: Program cost attribution**
  - **Validates: Requirements 13.4**

## Complete Cycle: Commit, Push, and Setup Next Tasks

After Task 19 completion, commit any fixes, push to git, and prepare tasks.md for the next cycle.

**IMPORTANT**: When setting up the next cycle, ALL tasks in the new tasks.md must be marked as `[ ]` not started. This is a fresh cycle start.

### Subtasks:

- [-] Commit and push any fixes
  - Stage all changes with `git add -A`
  - Create descriptive commit message if fixes were needed
  - Push to origin/main

- [ ] Setup next task cycle in tasks.md
  - Read FOUNDATION/tasks.md to identify next tasks (Task 20 from FOUNDATION)
  - Move completed Task 19 to completed-tasks.md with full details
  - Update tasks.md with Task 20 as the new main task
  - **CRITICAL**: Ensure ALL tasks in tasks.md are marked as `[ ]` not started (including Task 20 AND "Complete cycle" task)
  - Update the "Complete cycle" subtask to reference Task 21 for the next iteration
  - Commit and push the updated files

---

## Next Cycle Preview

After Task 19 & cycle completion, the next cycle will focus on:
- **Task 20**: Implement security and compliance features (from FOUNDATION)
- **Complete cycle**: Commit, push, and setup next tasks

---

## Notes

- Property tests marked with `*` are required for correctness validation
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Use the design document for detailed implementation guidance
- Refer to FOUNDATION/tasks.md for the complete task list
- Refer to completed-tasks.md for history of completed work
- DynamoDB local can be used for testing without AWS credentials
