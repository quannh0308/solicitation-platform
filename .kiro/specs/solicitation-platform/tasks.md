# Implementation Tasks - Current Cycle

## Current Focus: Task 10 - Implement channel adapter framework

This task list shows the current 2-task implementation cycle. After completing these tasks, the next cycle will be loaded from FOUNDATION.

**Note**: Completed tasks are tracked in `completed-tasks.md` to keep this file focused on current work.

  - Define interface methods (getChannelId, deliver, configure, healthCheck, isShadowMode)
  - Create DeliveryResult and DeliveredCandidate models
  - _Validates: Requirements 7.1, 7.2, 7.3_

- [ ]* 10.2 Write property test for channel adapter interface compliance
  - **Property 21: Channel adapter interface compliance**
  - **Validates: Requirements 7.1**

- [ ]* 10.3 Write property test for delivery status tracking
  - **Property 22: Delivery status tracking**
  - **Validates: Requirements 7.3**

- [ ] 10.4 Implement shadow mode support
  - Add shadow mode flag to adapter configuration
  - Implement logging without actual delivery
  - _Validates: Requirements 7.5, 14.5_

- [ ]* 10.5 Write property test for shadow mode non-delivery
  - **Property 23: Shadow mode non-delivery**
  - **Validates: Requirements 7.5, 14.5**

- [ ] 10.6 Implement rate limiting and queueing
  - Add rate limit tracking per channel
  - Implement queue for rate-limited candidates
  - _Validates: Requirements 7.6_

- [ ]* 10.7 Write property test for rate limiting queue behavior
  - **Property 24: Rate limiting queue behavior**
  - **Validates: Requirements 7.6**

## Complete Cycle: Commit, Push, and Setup Next Tasks

After Task 10 completion, commit any fixes, push to git, and prepare tasks.md for the next cycle.

### Subtasks:

- [ ] Commit and push any fixes
  - Stage all changes with `git add -A`
  - Create descriptive commit message if fixes were needed
  - Push to origin/main

- [ ] Setup next task cycle in tasks.md
  - Read FOUNDATION/tasks.md to identify next tasks (Task 11 from FOUNDATION)
  - Update tasks.md with Task 11 and new cycle completion task
  - Move completed Task 10 to completed-tasks.md
  - Commit and push the updated files

---

## Next Cycle Preview

After Task 10 & cycle completion, the next cycle will focus on:
- **Task 11**: Implement email channel adapter (from FOUNDATION)
- **Complete cycle**: Commit, push, and setup next tasks

## Notes

- Property tests marked with `*` are required for correctness validation
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Use the design document for detailed implementation guidance
- Refer to FOUNDATION/tasks.md for the complete task list
- Refer to completed-tasks.md for history of completed work
- DynamoDB local can be used for testing without AWS credentials
