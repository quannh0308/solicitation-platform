# Implementation Tasks - Current Cycle

## Current Focus: Task 12 - Checkpoint - Ensure serving and channel tests pass

This task list shows the current 2-task implementation cycle. After completing these tasks, the next cycle will be loaded from FOUNDATION.

**Note**: Completed tasks are tracked in `completed-tasks.md` to keep this file focused on current work.

## Task Status Legend
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[~]` - In progress  
- `[x]` - Complete
- `[*]` - Property-based test task

## Current Task Cycle

- [x] Task 12: Checkpoint - Ensure serving and channel tests pass
- [-] Complete cycle - Commit, push, and setup next tasks

---

## Task 12 Details: Checkpoint - Ensure serving and channel tests pass

Verify that all serving API and channel adapter tests pass successfully.

### Subtasks:

- [ ] 12.1 Run all serving tests
  - Execute `./gradlew :solicitation-serving:test`
  - Verify all tests pass with no errors
  - Verify all property tests complete 100+ iterations
  - _Validates: Requirements 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6_

- [ ] 12.2 Run all channel tests
  - Execute `./gradlew :solicitation-channels:test`
  - Verify all tests pass with no errors
  - Verify all property tests complete 100+ iterations
  - _Validates: Requirements 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.5, 7.6, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.6, 18.5, 18.6_

- [ ] 12.3 Verify build succeeds with no warnings
  - Execute `./gradlew build`
  - Ensure all modules build successfully
  - Check for any compilation warnings

- [ ] 12.4 Review test coverage
  - Verify all core functionality is tested
  - Ensure property tests cover all correctness properties
  - Identify any gaps in test coverage

## Complete Cycle: Commit, Push, and Setup Next Tasks

After Task 12 completion, commit any fixes, push to git, and prepare tasks.md for the next cycle.

**IMPORTANT**: When setting up the next cycle, ALL tasks in the new tasks.md must be marked as `[ ]` not started. This is a fresh cycle start.

### Subtasks:

- [-] Commit and push any fixes
  - Stage all changes with `git add -A`
  - Create descriptive commit message if fixes were needed
  - Push to origin/main

- [ ] Setup next task cycle in tasks.md
  - Read FOUNDATION/tasks.md to identify next tasks (Task 13 from FOUNDATION)
  - Move completed Task 12 to completed-tasks.md with full details
  - Update tasks.md with Task 13 as the new main task
  - **CRITICAL**: Ensure ALL tasks in tasks.md are marked as `[ ]` not started (including Task 13 AND "Complete cycle" task)
  - Update the "Complete cycle" subtask to reference Task 14 for the next iteration
  - Commit and push the updated files

---

## Next Cycle Preview

After Task 12 & cycle completion, the next cycle will focus on:
- **Task 13**: Implement batch ingestion workflow (from FOUNDATION)
- **Complete cycle**: Commit, push, and setup next tasks

---

## Notes

- Property tests marked with `*` are required for correctness validation
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Use the design document for detailed implementation guidance
- Refer to FOUNDATION/tasks.md for the complete task list
- Refer to completed-tasks.md for history of completed work
- DynamoDB local can be used for testing without AWS credentials
