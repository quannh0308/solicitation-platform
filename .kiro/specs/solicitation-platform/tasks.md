### Subtasks:

- [ ] Commit and push any fixes
  - Stage all changes with `git add -A`
  - Create descriptive commit message if fixes were needed
  - Push to origin/main

- [ ] Setup next task cycle in tasks.md
  - Read FOUNDATION/tasks.md to identify next tasks (Task 12 from FOUNDATION)
  - Move completed Task 11 to completed-tasks.md with full details
  - Update tasks.md with Task 12 as the new main task
  - **CRITICAL**: Ensure ALL tasks in tasks.md are marked as `[ ]` not started (including Task 12 AND "Complete cycle" task)
  - Update the "Complete cycle" subtask to reference Task 13 for the next iteration
  - Commit and push the updated files

- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Use the design document for detailed implementation guidance
- Refer to FOUNDATION/tasks.md for the complete task list
- Refer to completed-tasks.md for history of completed work
- DynamoDB local can be used for testing without AWS credentials
