## Key Differences from Solicitation Use Cases

### Traditional Solicitation
- **Action**: Request customer input (review, rating, survey)
- **Value**: Collect feedback to improve products/services
- **Timing**: After customer action (purchase, watch, service)
- **Success**: Submission rate

### Expansion Use Cases
- **Action**: Deliver value to customer (support, offer, protection, recommendation)
- **Value**: Improve customer experience, prevent negative outcomes
- **Timing**: Before or during customer need (proactive)
- **Success**: Problem prevention, conversion, satisfaction

---

## Architecture Reusability

All expansion use cases leverage the same core architecture:

```
Data Ingestion → Filtering → Scoring → Storage → Multi-Channel Delivery
```

**What Changes**:
- Data sources (fraud logs vs. purchase history)
- Filter logic (anomaly detection vs. eligibility)
- Scoring models (fraud risk vs. purchase intent)
- Action type (alert vs. recommendation)

**What Stays the Same**:
- Core pipeline architecture
- DynamoDB storage
- Multi-channel delivery
- Plug-and-play extensibility
