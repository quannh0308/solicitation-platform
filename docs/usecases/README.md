# Use Case Diagrams

> **Platform Rebranding Note**: This platform was formerly known as the "General Engagement Platform". We've rebranded to "Customer Engagement & Action Platform (CEAP)" to better reflect its expanded capabilities. Package names (`com.ceap.*`) and module names (`ceap-*`) have been updated to match the new branding.

This directory contains detailed flow diagrams for each use case, showing:
- Actor interactions
- Data ingestion flows
- Data contribution flows
- Scheduled jobs
- Processing timelines
- Metrics and success criteria

## Diagram Types

Each use case includes:

### 1. Actor Interaction Diagram
Shows how different actors (customers, teams, services) interact with the system over time.

### 2. Data Ingestion Flow
Detailed step-by-step flow showing:
- Data source extraction
- ETL transformation
- Filter pipeline execution
- Scoring model invocation
- Storage operations

### 3. Data Contribution Flow
Shows how customers interact with engagements:
- Delivery channel (email, in-app, push, etc.)
- Customer engagement (open, click, submit)
- Response collection
- Metrics tracking

### 4. Scheduled Jobs
Timeline of automated jobs:
- Daily batch processing
- Email campaign delivery
- Data warehouse exports
- Metrics aggregation
- Model retraining

### 5. Processing Timeline
Minute-by-minute breakdown showing:
- Lambda execution times
- Data volumes at each stage
- Filter pass rates
- Scoring throughput
- Storage operations

## How to Read These Diagrams

### Symbols
- `┌─┐` = Component/Service
- `│` = Data flow
- `▼` = Direction of flow
- `├─>` = Branch/Fork
- `T+Xms` = Timeline marker (milliseconds)

### Data Volumes
- Numbers show candidates at each stage
- Percentages show filter pass rates
- Metrics show conversion rates

### Timing
- Batch: Shows clock time (2:00 AM, 10:00 AM)
- Reactive: Shows relative time (T+0ms, T+100ms)
