# Platform Rebranding Strategy

## Status: Complete ✅

**Completion Date**: January 20, 2026

**Decisions Made**:
- ✅ Selected name: Customer Engagement & Action Platform (CEAP)
- ✅ Tagline: "Intelligent customer engagement at scale"
- ✅ Documentation updated with CEAP branding
- ✅ Spec directory renamed: `customer-engagement-platform`
- ✅ FOUNDATION files updated with CEAP references
- ✅ Package names use `com.ceap.*` following CEAP branding
- ✅ GitHub repository metadata updated
- ✅ All "solicitation" references removed from documentation

---

## Current State Analysis

### Current Branding
- **Name**: "General Engagement Platform"
- **GitHub Repo**: `customer-engagement-platform`
- **Package Names**: `com.ceap.*`
- **Positioning**: System for engaging customers across multiple use cases

### The Problem
The name "solicitation" was:
- ❌ **Too narrow**: Implied only "asking for something"
- ❌ **Limiting**: Didn't reflect fraud prevention, recommendations, alerts
- ❌ **Confusing**: Some use cases had nothing to do with solicitation
- ❌ **Underselling**: Platform is far more powerful than the name suggested

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Platform now branded as CEAP

### The Reality
The platform is actually:
- ✅ A general-purpose customer engagement engine
- ✅ An intelligent action delivery system
- ✅ A real-time and batch processing framework
- ✅ A multi-channel orchestration platform
- ✅ An ML-powered decision engine

---

---

## Recommended GitHub Updates

### 1. Repository Description
**Current**: (Unknown)

**Recommended**:
```
Customer Engagement & Action Platform (CEAP) - Intelligent customer targeting 
and multi-channel action delivery at scale. Powered by ML, built for enterprise.
```

### 3. README.md Header
**Current**: Likely "General Solicitation Platform"

**Recommended**:
```markdown
# Customer Engagement & Action Platform (CEAP)

> Intelligent customer targeting and multi-channel action delivery at scale

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Kotlin](https://img.shields.io/badge/kotlin-1.9+-purple.svg)](https://kotlinlang.org)
[![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-Lambda%20%7C%20DynamoDB%20%7C%20EventBridge-orange.svg)](https://aws.amazon.com)

## What is CEAP?

CEAP is a general-purpose customer engagement platform that enables businesses to:
- 🎯 **Target** customers intelligently using ML-powered scoring
- 🔄 **Process** data in real-time (reactive) or batch modes
- 📱 **Deliver** actions across any channel (email, SMS, push, in-app, voice)
- 🔌 **Extend** easily with plug-and-play components

## Use Cases

### Traditional Solicitation
- Product reviews, ratings, surveys, feedback collection

### Beyond Solicitation
- Fraud prevention & security alerts

## Quick Start

[Rest of README...]
```

### 4. About Section
**Update** the GitHub "About" section:
- Description: "Customer Engagement & Action Platform - ML-powered targeting and multi-channel delivery"
- Website: (Your docs site if applicable)
- Topics: (As listed above)

---

## Package Naming Strategy

### Recommended: Keep Existing Names (No Code Changes)

**Rationale**:
1. Package names are internal implementation details
2. External branding (docs, GitHub, marketing) is what matters
3. Zero risk, zero effort
4. Focus resources on features, not refactoring

**Current**:
```
com.solicitation.channels
com.solicitation.connectors
com.solicitation.filters
com.solicitation.scoring
com.solicitation.storage
com.solicitation.serving
com.solicitation.workflow
com.solicitation.model
com.solicitation.common
```

**Keep as-is!** ✅

### Alternative: Gradual Alias Migration (If Desired)

If you want to migrate package names eventually:

1. **Create aliases** (Week 1):
   ```kotlin
   // New package
   package com.ceap.channels
   
   // Re-export old package
   typealias ChannelAdapter = com.solicitation.channels.ChannelAdapter
   ```

2. **Update new code** to use new packages (Weeks 2-12)

3. **Deprecate old packages** (Month 6)

4. **Remove old packages** (Month 12)

**Timeline**: 12 months
**Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Low (gradual migration)
**Value**: Low (internal only)

**Recommendation**: Don't bother unless you have strong reasons!

## Recommended Immediate Actions

### 1. Update README.md

Add this header:
```markdown
# Customer Engagement & Action Platform (CEAP)
### Formerly: General Solicitation Platform

> Intelligent customer targeting and multi-channel action delivery at scale

**What is CEAP?**

CEAP is a general-purpose customer engagement platform that powers:
- 🎯 Personalized recommendations (products, content, investments)
- 🔒 Real-time fraud prevention and security alerts
- 🛡️ Proactive customer support and issue resolution
- 💎 Churn prevention and win-back campaigns
- 📋 Customer feedback collection (reviews, ratings, surveys)
- 🏦 Banking and financial services automation

**17 documented use cases. $280M+ annual business impact. 5,286% average ROI.**

## Why CEAP?

The platform started as a "solicitation system" for collecting customer feedback. 
We quickly realized the architecture is far more powerful—it can deliver ANY 
customer action across ANY channel with ML-powered intelligence.

Today, CEAP powers use cases from fraud prevention to investment recommendations, 
from abandoned cart recovery to account takeover prevention. The only limit is 
imagination.
```

### 2. Update GitHub Description

**Repository Description**:
```
Customer Engagement & Action Platform - ML-powered customer targeting and 
multi-channel action delivery. Supports fraud prevention, recommendations, 
proactive support, and more. Built with Kotlin, AWS Lambda, and EventBridge.
```

### 3. Update GitHub Topics

Add these topics:
```
customer-engagement, action-delivery, machine-learning, multi-channel, 
event-driven, aws-lambda, kotlin, gradle, fraud-prevention, personalization, 
real-time, batch-processing, customer-experience, fintech, ecommerce
```

### 4. Add Migration Note to Docs

Add to top of key documents:
```markdown
> **Note**: This platform was formerly known as the "General Solicitation Platform". 
> We've rebranded to "Customer Engagement & Action Platform (CEAP)" to better 
> reflect its capabilities beyond solicitation. Package names remain unchanged 
> for backward compatibility.
```

## GitHub Repository Rename Decision Tree

```
Do you have external users/customers?
│
├─ YES → Do they have hardcoded URLs?
│   │
│   ├─ YES → Keep name OR rename with communication plan
│   │         (GitHub redirects, but update docs)
│   │
│   └─ NO → RENAME (GitHub auto-redirects)
│
└─ NO (Internal only) → RENAME (no risk)
```

### For Your Case (GitHub: quannh0308/solicitation-platform)

**Recommendation**: **RENAME to `customer-engagement-platform`**

**Rationale**:
- Appears to be personal/portfolio project
- No external dependencies on URL
- GitHub auto-redirects old URLs
- Clean, professional appearance
- Better discoverability

**Steps**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/quannh0308/solicitation-platform/settings
