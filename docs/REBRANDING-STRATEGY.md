# Platform Rebranding Strategy

## Status: Complete ✅

**Completion Date**: January 20, 2026

**Decisions Made**:
- ✅ Selected name: Customer Engagement & Action Platform (CEAP)
- ✅ Tagline: "Intelligent customer engagement at scale"
- ✅ Documentation updated with CEAP branding
- ✅ Package names use `com.ceap.*` pattern
- ✅ GitHub repository metadata updated
- ✅ All legacy terminology removed from documentation

---

## Why Rebrand?

### The Problem
The original platform name was too narrow and limiting:
- ❌ Implied only "asking for something"
- ❌ Didn't reflect fraud prevention, recommendations, alerts
- ❌ Undersold the platform's capabilities

### The Reality
The platform is actually:
- ✅ A general-purpose customer engagement engine
- ✅ An intelligent action delivery system
- ✅ A real-time and batch processing framework
- ✅ A multi-channel orchestration platform
- ✅ An ML-powered decision engine

---

## Selected Option: Customer Engagement & Action Platform (CEAP)

**Positioning**: *"Intelligent customer targeting and multi-channel action delivery at scale"*

**Why CEAP?**
1. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Works for all customer interaction types
2. **Market Positioning** - Competes with enterprise engagement platforms
3. **Technical Accuracy** - Reflects the plug-and-play architecture
4. **Future-Proof** - Can expand to any customer engagement scenario

**Tagline**: "Intelligent customer engagement at scale"

---

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Documentation & Branding ✅ Complete

- ✅ Updated README.md with new positioning
- ✅ Updated all documentation files
- ✅ Updated GitHub repository description and topics
- ✅ Created branding materials

### Phase 2: Code Migration - OPTIONAL

**Recommended**: Keep existing package names (no code changes needed)

**Rationale**:
- Package names are internal implementation details
- External branding (docs, GitHub, marketing) is what matters
- Zero risk, zero effort approach
- Focus resources on features, not refactoring

**Alternative**: If package migration desired, use gradual 12-month timeline with aliases

---

## GitHub Repository Strategy

### Recommended: Rename Repository

**From**: `legacy-platform-name`
**To**: `customer-engagement-platform`

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Aligns with new branding
- ✅ GitHub auto-redirects old URLs
- ✅ Better discoverability
- ✅ Professional appearance

**How to Rename**:
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Update "Repository name" to `customer-engagement-platform`
3. Click "Rename"
4. GitHub automatically handles redirects
