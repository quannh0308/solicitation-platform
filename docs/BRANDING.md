## Elevator Pitch

### 30-Second Version

CEAP is an intelligent customer engagement platform that helps businesses deliver the right action to the right customer at the right time—whether that's a personalized recommendation, a fraud alert, a retention offer, or a proactive support message. Powered by ML, delivered across any channel, at enterprise scale.

### 60-Second Version

CEAP is a cloud-native platform that transforms how businesses engage with customers. Instead of generic mass communications, CEAP uses machine learning to identify the perfect moment and channel to deliver personalized actions—from product recommendations and fraud alerts to retention offers and proactive support.

Built on AWS with a plug-and-play architecture, CEAP processes millions of customer signals daily, scores opportunities in real-time, and delivers actions across email, in-app, push, SMS, and voice channels. The result? Higher conversion rates, reduced churn, prevented fraud, and improved customer satisfaction—all while maintaining sub-30ms latency and enterprise-grade security.
